I am a third-year PhD student at ENS Paris-Saclay, under the supervision of Pascal Larzabal, [Mohammed Nabil El Korso](https://l2s.centralesupelec.fr/en/u/el-korso-mohammed-nabil/) and Isabelle Vin. 


My current research focuses on dynamic image reconstruction using computational and statistical methods. Specifically, I work on inference in state-space models, most notably hidden Markov models, with an emphasis on sequential Bayesian inference. This work builds on my initial exploration of inverse problems and algorithm unrolling in static image reconstruction, providing a foundation for tackling more complex, time-varying scenarios. While radio astronomy is one prominent application of these techniques, the methods themselves extend to a variety of high-dimensional, noisy data contexts.
