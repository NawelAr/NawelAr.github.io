I am a third-year PhD student at ENS Paris-Saclay, under the supervision of Pascal Larzabal, [Mohammed Nabil El Korso](https://l2s.centralesupelec.fr/en/u/el-korso-mohammed-nabil/) and Isabelle Vin. My current research focuses on dynamic image reconstruction using computational and statistical methods, particularly through state-space and hidden Markov models, with applications in radio astronomy.
