I am a third-year PhD student at ENS Paris-Saclay, under the supervision of Pascal Larzabal, [Mohammed Nabil El Korso](https://l2s.centralesupelec.fr/en/u/el-korso-mohammed-nabil/) and Isabelle Vin. 


My current research focuses on dynamic image reconstruction using computational and statistical methods. Specifically, I work on inference in state-space models, with an emphasis on Bayesian inference. This work builds on my initial exploration of inverse problems and algorithm unrolling in static image reconstruction, providing a foundation for tackling more complex, time-varying scenarios. 

While radio astronomy is one prominent application of these techniques, the methods themselves extend to a variety of high-dimensional, noisy data contexts.
